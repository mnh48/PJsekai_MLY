The javascript file is only used for pages written in Beringin
This is because I need horizontal scrolling for those pages
as Beringin is written vertically, not horizontally

3. Scroll
scroll.js is taken from documentation of horizontal.js
It is the loader of the javascript file horizontal.js
It should be under the same license as horizontal.js

Please see the license files in the same directory for the license text,
they were included here if the original file came with the license file.
On other circumstances where it does not come with the license file,
a link will be put in this file you're reading that point towards the
original license text for the JS file.
